 * Solid-style fine-grained reactivity.

 * writes invalidate every subscriber. Cross-async-boundary tracking
 * uses `AsyncLocalStorage` so reads after an `await` still subscribe
 * the correct context.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const [status, setStatus] = signal("streaming")
 * text(({ style }) => style.success(status()))   // auto-subscribes
 * setStatus("done")
 * ```
 *
 * Builds on three primitives:
 *   - `signal`    — reactive value.
 *   - `memo`      — cached derived signal.
 *   - `effect`    — imperative side-effect that re-runs on dep change.
 *
 * Widgets expose `Reactive<T>` props and call `unwrap()` inside
 * `_render` to resolve them — that's the bridge from app-level
 * signals into the render tree.

 * pointers), reading the live `#contexts` of each frame's node and
 * falling back to the context's default if no ancestor provides it.
 *
 * The owner chain is the render-call ancestry captured at frame push

 * yourself reaching for it, also consider whether storing a *plain*
 * value (the underlying data, not the chain/builder) and recomputing
 * the function-y derivative inside a `memo` is cleaner — usually it
 * is.

// ---- async -----------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Resource-style async accessor. `fn` reads signals (tracked); the
 * effect re-fires when any of them change. Each run notifies the
 * nearest `SuspenseContext` so a surrounding boundary (Stream's
 * append, a `suspense()` widget) can observe pending work.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const highlighted = createAsync(
 *   async (prev) => highlight(unwrap(props.code)),
 *   { initialValue: unwrap(props.code) },
 * )
 * text(highlighted)
 * ```
 *
 * **Stale-write protection**: each run bumps a generation counter;
 * late `.then` callbacks check it and skip `setValue` if a newer run
 * has already fired. The boundary is decremented exactly once per
 * increment (in the settle callback, regardless of staleness).
 *
 * **`prev`** is the previously resolved value (or `initialValue`) —
 * useful for diff-based fetches. Reading it does *not* track, so
 * resolving the new value won't re-fire the effect.
 *
 * **No active boundary** → increment/decrement no-op, work is
 * fire-and-forget. Right for UI surface widgets that re-render
 * cheaply on signal change. The Stream surface installs a boundary
 * per appended subtree so committed-to-scrollback rows always reflect
 * resolved values.
