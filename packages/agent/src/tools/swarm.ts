/**
 * Swarm tools — `agent_spawn` and `agent_send`.
 *
 * Both require `ctx.agent` (the running agent, set by the harness)
 * and `ctx.swarm` (the swarm registry, set when the agent was
 * constructed with one). They throw `MISSING_TOOL_CONTEXT` cleanly
 * otherwise so the model sees a useful error rather than a silent
 * no-op.
 *
 * Lifecycle: `agent_spawn` returns immediately with a small ack — no
 * streamable, no grace race. The spawned subagent runs in the
 * background; its outward messages flow back to the parent through
 * the swarm's auto-forward (a `<agent>` system message lands in the
 * parent's queue at each natural step-end). The orchestrator decides
 * what to do next when it sees those.
 *
 * `agent_send` is the back-channel: the orchestrator addresses a
 * subagent by name and the message lands as a `role: "user"` inject
 * (the orchestrator IS the user from the child's perspective).
