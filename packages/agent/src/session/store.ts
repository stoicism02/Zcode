/**
 * Storage backend for a `Session`'s DAG.
 *
 * The store is the source of truth for nodes. `Session` reads through
 * the store for chain walks, and writes new nodes via `write()`.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   - `MemoryStore` — `Map<uuid, SessionNode>`, no persistence. Used
 *     by tests and ephemeral / in-process sessions.
 *   - `JsonlStore` — append-only JSONL file. Eager-loads all records on
 *     `load()`; future versions may add lazy reads + LRU caching.
 *
 * Async by design — even `get()` may involve I/O for backends that don't
 * cache the full DAG in memory. Callers that need synchronous reads
 * should pre-warm via `Session`'s chain walk (which populates Session's
 * own caches as it goes).
 *
 * `root` is the most recently appended node. Loading a store sets `root`
 * from the last persisted record. Writes advance `root` synchronously
 * (the in-memory state must reflect the append before `write()` resolves)
 * so subsequent `root` reads see the new node — even if the underlying
 * I/O completes asynchronously.
